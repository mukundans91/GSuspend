This is one of my first forays into the python world.

This project evolved on a need basis.

Previously I wanted to suspend my laptop after certain time interval and I found out that for that I had to run certain 
commands in the shell.

This just wraps up all the commands neatly into one command and can be used from the shell directly .

First copy the file to /usr/bin

Then it can be used in two ways

gsuspend now

or 

gsuspend after n

wher n is the number of minutes
